    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a fourth year at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Game Design and Development and minoring in Software Engineering. My dream is to work as a game programmer, and strive to do as much as I can to achieve that goal. I am currently looking for an internship for the Summer of 2024 that is related to software in some way. This could either be web or game development, UI/UX design, graphics programming, and so much more.</p>
