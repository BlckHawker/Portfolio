            "Description": "After a few years of creating solvers of KTANE mods, I decided to create some mods of my own. Not only did I have to write the logic of solving the mod, I also had to write the instructions, model it, and write the logic for interactions. I like creating mods more than creating solvers since it gives me more freedom in terms of creativity. The modding community also has a sub group on Twitch, mostly known as “Twitch Plays”, where players can go to a Twitch channel and play the game through chat commands. There is a special command called “force solve” where the module solves itself. Although it’s unnecessary, most modders implement this by having the puzzle figure out the calculations itself and pressing its own buttons to solve it.",
