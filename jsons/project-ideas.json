            "Title": "Mentor Schedule Maker",
            "Description": "At my time at RIT, I joined the <a href=\"https://sse.rit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Software Engineers</a>. It's an academic organization that mainly focused on mentoring (tutoring) students who are majoring in Software Engineering related field. The \"Mentor Head\" would be responsible for making the schedule of which mentor(s) would be assigned each shift based on their availability. Since the Mentor Head has many other responsibilities, I thought it would be a good idea to alleviate one of those problems with a schedule generator. Given the name and availability of each mentor, the software would generate all possible schedules, verifying that nobody is overworked."

            "Description": "As someone who spends a lot of time in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/ktane-160061833166716928\" target=\"_blank\">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (KTANE)</a> server, I tend to answer the same questions multiple time as new people decide to mod the game. Although I am happy to answer their question, it can be repetitive and time consuming, especially if the person does not have a lot of programming/Unity knowledge.\nThe server does have a channel that resembles a FAQ forum, though it can be difficult to navigate through when you're looking for a specific question. I plan for this bot to be an improvement of the FAQ channel by having questions to be grouped by their similarity. For example, one section could be about mod making in unity while another one can be about manual making with HTML. The collections of questions can be navigated through reactions. Since the bot will be in the official discord server, it should have a better chance of being used as opposed to various tutorials that are scattered on YouTube."

            "Description": "I was always mesmerized with Rubik's Cubes. When I finally learned an algorithm that guarantees the cube would be solved, I felt a great wave of pride. Although I never had the time to get into the hobby myself, I enjoy watching competitive cubing. I find the idea of memorizing patterns in order to optimize the solving process fascinating. A few years later, I took a class that focused on the use AI in games. We learned about neural networking and Q learning (a machine learning algorithm where the machine iteratively learns how to solve something and improves over time). I figured a rubik's cube would be a great puzzle to understand the algorithm more."

            "Title": "Rock Paper Scissors Boids",
            "Description": "At RIT, I took a class that taught me how to use Unity, mainly scripting. One of the projects I was assigned was to create a project use boids (artificial intelligence to simulate free will of objects, mainly through movement). The theme of my project, at the time, was Human vs Zombies (a large game of tag where the zombies are it). The humans' only job was to run away, while the zombies' job was to chase the humans. There was nothing for the \"player\" to do besides watch the simulation run.\nI have the idea of changing the theme to Rock Paper Scissors where each boids would run away and chase each target. When a collision happens, a boid will change to another team. For example, rocks colliding to paper will turn into paper. I am planning to add sliders that will change the stats of each boids including but not limited to: movement speed, the radius of their vision, how much they prefer chasing something rather than running away, etc. The player will also have the option to place obstacles anywhere on the map that all boids will need to avoid in order to not get deleted."

            "Title": "Dynamic Binary Puzzle Solver",
            "Description": "I created a <a href=\"https://www.puzzle-binairo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Binary Puzzle (also known as Binario)</a> solver during my <a href=\"/portfolio/projects-ktane.html\" target=\"_blank\">KTANE solver saga</a>. The KTANE version always generated a 6x6 puzzle, but I have recently started solving some with a larger size. I want to challenge myself by making a solver where the dimensions are not constant. This will force me to think about what rules work for one size and not for others and apply them in the appropriate context."

            "Title": "Budget Tracker",
            "Description": "I like my life to be organized, and technology has made that job easier. This applies to budgeting apps including a wishlist function. However, a big task like this can be done in several ways, and I never found an app that exactly fits my preferences; not to mention one that is free without some form of restriction.\nI want to be able to have items sectioned into categories (Needs, Wants, Savings, etc). These categories can then either have items or more subcategories, making a tree structure with a limited depth. The user will have the option of depositing or withdrawing money to/from a certain item/category along with notes. I'm planning on having depositing be customizable where the user has the option of automatically giving a certain category a percentage of the deposit. Or have a priority system where all the money goes into a certain category until the \"goal amount\" is reached. Then all deposited money will go into the next category. I also want each category to have its own stats section where users can see what they're spending most of their money on."

            "Title": "Sudoku Solver",
            "Description": "I have learned to do Sudoku puzzles at a very young age. However, I never found myself finishing most of them. I found myself being very slow at deducing what the number of each cell was as I needed to slowly look at the respective row, column, and block. I always wondered if there were more sophisticated deductions, and I think making a solver will aid me in answering that question."

            "Description": "In 2022, I made <a href=\"/portfolio/projects.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</a> where one cell of the game is its own version of tic tac toe. I made it two players as it was a school project and I was pressed for time. I always wanted to make it a single-player game to challenge my skills of creating AI that replicates playing against a real person.\nI have thought of using different algorithms to achieve this goal and have different levels of difficulty. I thinking of having \"Easy\" perform random moves and harder difficulties using mini-maxing with different parameters."
