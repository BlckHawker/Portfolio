    "Description": "My name is firstName Bentley. I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Game Design and Development and minoring in Software Engineering. I discovered my love for video games when I was 4 years old, and decided then that I wanted to be part of the process of making video games. I discovered my love for coding around my junior year of high school. I like being given complicated problems and solving them through unique ways. I try to learn as much as I can about data structures, coding principles, and game design elements in order to acheieve my dream."
