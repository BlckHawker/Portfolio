  "Description": "My name is firstName Jackson-Bentley. I am a software developer with a background in Software Engineering and Game Design and Development from Rochester Institute of Technology. I discovered my love for video games when I was four years old which sparked my aspiration of wanting to be part of the creation of video games. I developed my passion for coding in my late years of high school. I have been increasing my skills by creating several personal projects with various programming languages since; all of which can be found on my GitHub. I like being given complicated problems and solving them in unique ways. I try to learn as much as possible including data structures, software engineering principles, and game design elements to achieve my dream."
